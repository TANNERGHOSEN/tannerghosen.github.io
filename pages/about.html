<h1 id="page">About</h1>
<p>I am Tanner Ghosen.
I graduated in 2021 from Buffalo State College with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Information Systems.
My field of interest is Web Development in Full Stack, with general indifference to either end, and a little bit of software development.
I enjoy creating websites and other code creations.</p>
