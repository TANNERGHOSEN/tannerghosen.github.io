<div hidden id="project2" class="project"><h2>Wasspord</h2><p>This is a password management program made using WinForms in C# & .NET that lets you store your passwords in a singular place for easier retrieval. Users can add their accounts, update their passwords and delete their accounts from the list, and save their individual set of accounts to a .wasspord extension file for future use with the program, which also keeps their information safe, alongside encrypting their password from potential viewers when they're not checking their passwords. The program comes with a password generator and autosaving functionality for information and settings alike.</p><a href="https://github.com/tannerghosen/Wasspord">GitHub Repo</a></div>
<div hidden id="project3" class="project"><h2>Password Generator API</h2><p>This is a Password Generator API created using the Express.js, Node.js and JavaScript. It can generate a randomly generated password of either a pre-determined or custom length, and return it either in JSON, XML or plain form. Also includes a form of validation against a basic regex.</p><a href="https://github.com/tannerghosen/PasswordGeneratorAPI">GitHub Repo</a></div>
<div hidden id="project4" class="project"><h2>Weather App</h2><p>This is a browser-based weather app made with React that tells you the weather in your location at that very point in time, using built in browser APIs to get your geolocation and fetch the weather from the API using your latitude and longitude. The API used for the weather is OpenWeatherMap, which allows the users to get a API Key with some restrictions. The program has a refresh button and automatically refreshes every 15 minutes the page is open.</p><a href="https://github.com/tannerghosen/WeatherApp">GitHub Repo</a></div>
